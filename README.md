## Tips of New Soundscape Page:
- Audio cards in new soundscape page are not draggable while the audios are playing.
- If the audio cards position has not changed, it will continue to play after the pause.
- Once you change the one of the audio card's position, such as drag it to up or down or delete it from the track, it will play from the start
- Two audios on the same line will play simultaneously
- Audio will play line by line
- The audios on the second row will not play until the first line of audio has been played.
